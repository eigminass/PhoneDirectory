# PhoneDirectory
This program implements phone directory using 3 different strategies and then demonstrate performance of each of them. It also has GUI which was written in pure java without using any particular technology to design GUI. I am currently working to improve the performance of different methods within this project.

This java project contains many brute force algorithms which should be replaced to clever ones in order to improve performance.
I am currently working to imrpove the speed of insert, findExNumber and delete methods.
